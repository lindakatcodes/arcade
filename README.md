# Welcome to the Arcade!

This project is my love letter to gaming. The games are a collection of games created following tutorials, inspired by other projects, or straight out of my imagination.
The core of the site is built with Astro, and the games are written in different flavors of JavaScript. All the styling is straight CSS. 
I hope you enjoy playing!
